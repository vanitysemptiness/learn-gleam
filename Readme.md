a project to learn gleam 
---
gleam is an erlang derivative that is used for highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.

###### starting a new project in monorepo
```bash
gleam new proeject_name
```
###### running
cd into whatever project base you want, at the level of the `gleam.toml`
```bash
gleam run
```
testing
```bash
gleam test
```

each project should have its own Readme.md, gleam.toml, and manifest.toml.
